## Google Global COVID Mobility Data
Data are updated weekly (Thursday evenings) to the Google COVID Mobility Reports [webpage](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)

<b>Metadata:</b> 
Data contain a daily time series of % change in busyness of different location types (parks/rec, retail, supermarkets, homes, etc.). Jan 3rd-Feb 3rd 2020 is used as baseline for comparison. Not all locations are included, only ones with sufficient data to protect privacy. 

The scale of the data for the US is at the county scale when possible. Outside the US the geographic scale varies by country.
