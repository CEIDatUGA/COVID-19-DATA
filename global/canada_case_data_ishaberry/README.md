# Canada COVID-19 Case Data

This data was downloaded daily through January 2021 from its original repository ( <https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada> ) recently moved from https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada. That repository itself downloads and cleans the data from this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D6okqtBS3S2NRC7GFVHzaZ67DuTw7LX49-fqSLwJyeo/edit?usp=sharing).

We have ceased updating this dataset. Users of this data should now obtain the datadset directly from <https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada>.

**Metadata:**

* cases.csv: Individual-level cases
* codebook.csv: Explanations for each variable in the dataset
* mortality.csv: Individual-level mortality
* recovered.csv: Time series of cumulative recovered
* testing_cumulative.csv: Time series of cumulative testing
* update_time.txt: Date and time of update
