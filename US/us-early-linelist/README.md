<b>Metadata:</b> See metadata tab

Multiple sources, see source column. 

<b>Sheets</b>
* Metadata: contains information about variables collected
* Data: Manually entered from media reports
* Merged-linelist: Because it was sometimes hard to determine from news reports the official dates of case reporting, we merged our linelist with county-level time series. Only some lines matched up and are included in the merged linelist. 
* First 350-400 cases: Earliest cases in the US that were verified to the best of our ability with information from March 2020.
