# COVID-19-DATA
Repository that stores the datasets used in different projects 

### Folder Code
stores .R and .Rmd files that generate some of the data files

### Data Files

#### - UScases_by_state_wikipedia.csv
Reads from wikipedia the number of non-repatriated COVID-19 cases in the US by state. Generated by read_UScases_wikipedia.R.

#### - worldCases.csv
Stores data read from wikipedia on the cumulative number of cases in a country. Added to each day by running get-world-data.Rmd. Wikipedia does not store these data by date so running daily at the same time is necessary to keep data current and accurate.
