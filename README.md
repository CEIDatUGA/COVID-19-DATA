Repository that stores datasets used in different COVID CEID projects. Repository will be made public in near future.  
=======
The datasets in the repository were compiled by members of the CEID COVID-19 working group. The data at the top level of the repository has been formated to be used 'as-is' and is updated often. Data sets were either created from html scraping or manually entered. In the case of the automated web scraping, the raw data and scripts are organized into sub-directories. The description of each data file along with the corresponding sub-directories are listed below.   

# Automated data sets
  These data sets were created using web scraping, or other automated methods to retrieve, aggregate, and organize public data. These data sets tend to be updated nightly. 
## China data
[China_casedata](#china_casedata) </br>

## US data  
[UScases_by_state_wikipedia.csv](#uscases_by_state_wikipedia): Number of new cases in a state by day. </br>
[USfatalities_by_state_wikipedia.csv](#usfatalities_by_state_wikipedia): Number of new case fatalities in a state by day. </br>

## Global
[worldCases.csv](#worldcases): Number of new cases in a country by day. </br>

# Manual data sets
  These data sets were created by manually entering each line from various sources. 
 
 longFormStateInterventions.csv : Running summary of interventions at the state level taken from reports and wikipedia

[interventionTimeSeries.csv](#interventiontimeseries): Reshaped version of longFormStateInterventions.csv that includes the intervention status of all US states on each date since the beginning of the outbreak. Updated daily.

## worldCases
Stores data read from wikipedia on the cumulative number of cases in a country. Added to each day by running `get-world-data.Rmd`to
extract data from [2020 coronavirus pandemic wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) and adds the current day to the dataset. Must be run every day at ~10 PM or extracted from archived pages on wayback machine. Wikipedia does not store these data by date so running daily at the same time is necessary to keep data current and accurate.

 Column name description of data file:
 - `Date`: Date of cumulative case record
 - `Country`: Country name
 - `Cases`: cumulative number of cases for `Country` on `Date`

## us-state-intervention-data

This subfolder contains information on non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented at the state level, including school closures, state of emergency declarations, etc. 

These data are scraped manually from [wikipedia entries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state_and_local_government_response_to_the_2020_coronavirus_pandemic) (housed on [this google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_mk1J3ElMH5EmPILcrx8s1KqHqdQYXCWroJeKTR3pV4/edit#gid=221668309)).

## Epi_characteristics

Table of epidemological characteristics of COVID-19 and other zoonotic outbreaks. Data was manually entered from research articles with a PubMed publication identification number. The data set was built to capture the most about of data, so many of the cases are incomplete. The same research article could be used for multiple lines if different outbreaks or statistics were reported. 

This is a static data set.
