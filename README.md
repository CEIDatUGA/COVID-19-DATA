### Folder Code
Stores .R and .Rmd files that generate some of the data files.

Extracts data from [2020 coronavirus pandemic in United States wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_the_United_States) and outputs file 'UScases_by_state_wikipedia.csv'.

#### - worldCases.csv
Stores data read from wikipedia on the cumulative number of cases in a country. Added to each day by running 'get-world-data.Rmd'. Wikipedia does not store these data by date so running daily at the same time is necessary to keep data current and accurate.
